## Usage

### Adding Stocks to Watchlist
1. Run a stock screening

3. The star will fill (★) and show a success toast
4. High-scoring stocks (85+) will trigger an auto-suggestion modal

2. View all your saved stocks with latest data
3. Sort by any column by clicking the header
4. Select multiple stocks for bulk operations
5. Export to CSV for external tracking
6. Remove stocks individually or in bulk

### Auto-Suggestion Modal
- Appears automatically after screening completes
- Shows stocks with score >= 85
- Allows bulk selection and addition
- Only shows stocks not already in watchlist

## Database Schema

The implementation uses the existing watchlist tables:
- `user_watchlists` - Stores user watchlists
- `user_watchlist_stocks` - Stores individual stock entries

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/watchlist
- Query params: `userEmail`
- Returns: Complete watchlist with latest screening data

### POST /api/watchlist
- Body: `{ action, symbol, userEmail, notes?, symbols? }`
- Actions: `add`, `remove`, `bulk-add`
- Returns: Success/error response

## Styling & Theming

All components follow the existing app theme:
- Dark mode with gray-800 backgrounds
- Purple/blue gradient buttons
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Hover effects and transitions
- Responsive design

## Future Enhancements

The implementation is designed to support future features:
- Multiple named watchlists
- Notes field for each stock
- Price alerts and notifications
- Performance tracking
- Watchlist sharing
- External portfolio integration

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Sign in to the application
2. Run a stock screening
3. Add stocks to watchlist using star buttons
4. Check auto-suggestion modal for high-scoring stocks
5. Navigate to watchlist page
6. Test sorting, filtering, and bulk operations
7. Export CSV and verify data

## Notes

- The implementation uses email-based user identification
- Watchlist entries persist until manually removed
- All operations include proper error handling
- The UI is fully responsive and accessible
- Toast notifications provide immediate feedback
